# learning-f-sharp
This is a repo where I will be storing the code that I have written while following this [F# tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7eNDJN758U) on YouTube!

## What This Repository Contains
- FirstFSharpApp
The folder that contains the code for my very first FSharpApp. This is a very simple application which requires an input of the user's name and outputs "Hello" then their name.
- [LearningLog](LearningLog.md)
This is just a file that's helping me to keep track of how far I have got in the tutorial and what I have done each week ðŸ™‚.
