# Learning Log

## 26th January 2021
I made my first F# console app where it gets an input from the user and makes an output. I am currently 5:55 into the video.  

## 2nd February 2021
I finished off the input/output section of the tutorial today - this covered formatting floating point values, padding in outputs and the casing used for functions.  

I went onto the bindings/mutables part of the tutorial. I made a new project for this to demonstrate the difference between let mutable and changing a ref.  

I am now onto making functions in F#, and I have started making a basic function that adds 2 numbers together in the functions project. While learning this, I discovered how you can cast numbers,  

I am currently 12:30 into the video.  

## 9th February 2021
I completed the functions section of the F# tutorial. This involved writing a recursive function to find a factorial value of a number, doubling numbers in a list, only outputting even numbers, and executing multiple functions.

I then moved onto the maths section of the tutorial. This involved looking at operators, which are the same as the other languages I have used, as well as finding the type of a variable, casting, and more advanced mathematical functions (abs, ceil, floor, log, log10, and square root).

I am currently 25:21 into the video.

## 16th February 2021
I completed the strings section of the tutorial. This looked at different types of strings, finding the length of one, getting an individual character, getting sections of a string, and using functions on a string.

I am currently 33:42 into the video.

## 23rd February 2021
The loops section of the tutorial has been completed. This looked at while and for loops in F#, as well as other ways of iterating. This included using a range and pipelining, as well as using the reduce function to find the sum of numbers in a range.

I am currently 38:38 into the video, and I also came across another video that intrigues me... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34C_7halqGw

## 2nd March 2021
The conditionals and list sections of the tutorial have been completed. The conditionals section looked at the if, elif and else, AND and OR operators, as well as match. The list section looked at how you can create a list, how to append one, ranges, yield, yield!, head, tail, as well as methods (.init, .filter, .map, .sort, .fold).

I am currently 55:25 into the video.

## 9th March
The enums, options and tuples sections of the tutorial have been completed. There are lots of similiarities between these and C#. Options are for when a function may not return a value and may use the .IsSome or .IsNone method.
