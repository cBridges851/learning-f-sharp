# Learning Log

## 26th January 2021
I made my first F# console app where it gets an input from the user and makes an output. I am currently 5:55 into the video.  

## 2nd February 2021
I finished off the input/output section of the tutorial today - this covered formatting floating point values, padding in outputs and the casing used for functions.  

I went onto the bindings/mutables part of the tutorial. I made a new project for this to demonstrate the difference between let mutable and changing a ref.  

I am now onto making functions in F#, and I have started making a basic function that adds 2 numbers together in the functions project. While learning this, I discovered how you can cast numbers,  

I am currently 12:30 into the video.  

## 9th February 2021
I completed the functions section of the F# tutorial. This involved writing a recursive function to find a factorial value of a number, doubling numbers in a list, only outputting even numbers, and executing multiple functions.

I then moved onto the maths section of the tutorial. This involved looking at operators, which are the same as the other languages I have used, as well as finding the type of a variable, casting, and more advanced mathematical functions (abs, ceil, floor, log, log10, and square root).

I am currently 25:21 into the video.

## 16th February 2021
I completed the strings section of the tutorial. This looked at different types of strings, finding the length of one, getting an individual character, getting sections of a string, and using functions on a string.

I am currently 33:42 into the video.

## 23rd February 2021
The loops section of the tutorial has been completed. This looked at while and for loops in F#, as well as other ways of iterating. This included using a range and pipelining, as well as using the reduce function to find the sum of numbers in a range.

I am currently 38:38 into the video, and I also came across another video that intrigues me... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34C_7halqGw
